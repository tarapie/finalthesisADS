Final code files ADS thesis
This project consists of the following files:
- simulation_sim_final, which is used to run the simulation, and save the results in a separate _results_ folder.
- analysis_sim_thesis.R, which is used to perform analyses on the results from the simulation,
as well as to plot the results, which are saved in a separate _figures_ folder. 

In the aux folder, the methods, libraries and data generating files can be found, which are auxiliary to the study.
Alongside this readme file is the sessionInfo.txt, which covers the specifics of the version of R used for this study.

The auxiliary files should first be run, after which the simulation can be run.
Then, the results can be analysed.
