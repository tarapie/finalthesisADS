Final code files thesis
This project consists of the following files:
1) libraries_sim_final.R
2) gendata_sim_final.R
3) methods_sim_final.R
4) simulation_sim_final
5) analysis_sim_thesis.R
6) plots_final (and plots_final_rmd) # code to generate (example) plots
7) sessionInfo.txt # To see the specifics of R used for this study
8) This readme file

First, run files 1-3 before running the simulation.
Second, run the simulation; since results are not properly saved,
do the analysis in one (and the same) session.
Third, analyse results. Use plots_final to get plots. Save them.
